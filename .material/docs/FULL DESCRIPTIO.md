# FULL DESCRIPTION

# **Project Heptadev: Platform Design & Strategy Document**

## **1. Executive Summary**

**Heptadev** is a new platform designed to connect people who have ideas with people who have the talent to build them. It solves the biggest problem in hiring: **Communication and Safety.**

Usually, clients struggle to explain what they want, and workers struggle to understand the requirements. Heptadev uses AI to fix this. It helps clients explain their ideas clearly without needing to know technical words, and it gives workers a clear plan.

**Key Goals:**

- **Safety Guarantee:** We ensure the project is delivered correctly and money is safe.
- **Easy Access:** Clients can find many talents easily, and people with skills can find jobs easily, from small quick tasks to large complex projects.
- **For Everyone:** This isn't just for coders. It is for anyone with a talent or career who can complete a task.

## **2. Why Heptadev is Different**

### **For Clients (The Idea Owners)**

- **Simple & Fast:** You don't need to be an expert. Just tell us what you want.
- **Flexible Detail:** You can choose a quick process or go deep into details if you want to.
- **Hidden Technical Stuff:** You don't see confusing technical terms unless you switch to "Advanced Mode." You focus on your idea; we handle the rest.

### **For Talent (The Workers)**

- **Clear Jobs:** You get a clear plan of what needs to be done.
- **Job Variety:** Access to all kinds of jobs, from small $50 tasks to huge corporate projects.
- **Fair Priority:** Enterprise partners get early access based on their subscription tier.

## **3. The Heptadev Engine (How it Works)**

### **Phase 1: Creating the Project (Client Side)**

1. **The Idea:** The user types a simple description of what they need (e.g., "I need a logo" or "Build me a house plan").
2. **The Process Choice:**
    - **Option A (Fast & Simple):** The AI asks 2-3 key questions and creates the plan automatically.
    - **Option B (Advanced):** The user can go through a detailed step-by-step process, tweak technical settings, and answer deep questions to get a very specific result.
3. **The Interview (AI Helper):**
    - The AI asks questions based on the user's idea.
    - **User Control:** Users can answer, skip, or say "I don't know." If they skip, the AI picks the best standard option.
    - **Documents:** Users can upload files, drawings, or audio notes.
4. **The Review:**
    - The AI shows a summary of the project.
    - **Tech Details Hidden:** By default, technical specs are hidden so the user isn't overwhelmed. They can click "Show Technical Details" if they really want to see or change them.
5. **Budget & Feasibility:**
    - The user sets their Budget and Deadline.
    - **The Check:** The AI checks if the budget matches the work.
        - *If Good:* Payment is ready.
        - *If Low:* The AI shows a **Warning**. It explains that the budget might be low for this amount of work.
    - **The Choice:** The user isn't forced to stop. They can accept the warning and **Continue Anyway** (knowing it might be harder to find talent), or they can adjust their budget.

### **Phase 2: Finding Talent**

1. **Public Project Profile:**
    - A clean version of the project goes live.
    - **IP Protection:** We hide sensitive **Intellectual Property** (unique ideas or secrets) from the public view so no one steals the idea before they are hired.
2. **Enterprise Priority Slots:**
    - Companies can pay for "Priority Access."
    - **Tier 1 (High Priority):** These companies see the project first.
    - **Tier 2 (Low Priority):** These companies see the project after Tier 1, but still *before* the general public.
    - **Public Access:** Finally, the project opens to everyone else.
3. **Applying & NDA:**
    - Talents apply for the job.
    - **NDA Rule:** Before a talent can be accepted or see the *full* secret details/files of the project, they must agree to a **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**. This keeps the client's secrets safe.

### **Phase 3: The Work & Payment**

1. **Selection:** The client picks the best person (or company) for the job.
2. **Payment & Escrow:**
    - The client deposits the money safely into Heptadev.
3. **Milestones & Custom Release:**
    - **AI Milestones:** The project is usually broken into steps (Milestones), and money is released automatically when a step is done. (but client have to approve a milestone).
    - **Manual Release:** The client *can* choose to release some money early if they want to help the worker (e.g., for materials).
    - **The Limit:** To keep things safe, the client cannot manually release more than **50%** of the total budget until the project is fully finished.
4. **Dispute Resolution:**
    - If there is a disagreement, the AI first tries to analyze the chat and project plan to solve it.
    - If that fails, a **Human Admin** reviews the case. *Note: Fees may be applied if a human review is required to resolve the issue.*

## **4. Post-Project Maintenance (Long Term Success)**

We don't just stop when the project is done.

1. **Maintenance Subscription:**
    - After the project is finished, the AI suggests a "Maintenance Plan."
    - Clients can subscribe to this. If they have an issue later, their request goes into a special "Maintenance Category."
2. **Priority Handling:**
    - Maintenance requests for projects built on Heptadev get **Priority** over random new tasks.
3. **Project History:**
    - **Timeline View:** A project can have a long life. It can have the original build, then Maintenance 1, then Maintenance 2.
    - **Data Access:** When a new person (or the same person) comes to do maintenance, the client can choose to give them access to the **Past History**.
    - This means the new worker can see the old chats, the original files, and what happened before, making it much easier to fix things.

## **5. Security & Verification (KYC)**

We want to make it easy to start, but keep bad actors out.

- **For Talent (Workers):** You do **NOT** need to verify your ID (KYC) for small jobs (e.g., under $100). You only need to verify for larger amounts.
- **For Clients:** You generally do **NOT** need to verify your ID at all to post jobs. Verification is only required if a Dispute happens or there is suspicious activity.

## **6. Business Model**

1. **Service Fees:** A small percentage taken from the transaction.
2. **Priority Slots:** Companies pay monthly for Tier 1 or Tier 2 access to jobs.
3. **Maintenance Subscriptions:** Recurring revenue for keeping projects running smooth.
